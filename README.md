# Molecule Discovery

Specification‑driven generation of novel molecules with property prediction (including uncertainty), high‑level non‑actionable synthesis ideas, and research‑grade reporting.

## Quickstart (Dev)

```bash
# Requires Python 3.11+
make setup  # optionally: make setup PY=python3.11
make test
```

CLI skeleton:

```bash
moldis --help
```

Safety: This project blocks harmful/illegal designs and never emits actionable synthesis instructions. All synthesis suggestions are high‑level only.
