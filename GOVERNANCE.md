# Project Governance

This project follows a lightweight governance model to balance velocity with quality and safety.

## Roles

- Maintainers: approve/merge PRs, set roadmap, enforce safety policies.
- Contributors: submit issues/PRs, review, improve docs and tests.

## Decision Making

- Technical decisions follow “rough consensus” among maintainers, guided by AGENTS.md and TASKS.md.
- Safety concerns override feature velocity.

## Releases

- Semantic versioning with tagged releases; changelog maintained per release.
